# ID Vouchers

**Track:** Financial Inclusion

**Challenge Statement:** Jakarta is experiencing a digital boom - this can open up new opportunities for small vendors, but they may also face challenges in adopting new technologies. Create a solution that helps to integrate this demographic into the wider economy.

## Project Overview

ID Vouchers is a platform enabling small food vendors in Jakarta, especially those not technically savvy, to prepare orders using QR vouchers bought online. These vouchers can be purchased through online shopping platforms and presented by consumers to vendors, who can then scan the QR code to provide the corresponding food items. The platform also allows vendors to manage their menu, setting items or the entire menu to "off" to indicate when items are out of stock. This system creates new opportunities for small vendors by streamlining the ordering process and making it easier to manage inventory and serve customers efficiently.
